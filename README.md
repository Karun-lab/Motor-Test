DOWNLOAD AND EXTRACT THE FILES 

Order to follow the operation
1.Make the connetions as per Schematics
2.Upload Arduino Code
3.Run Python Code

Note: The above displayed image is a CAD model of one part of the entire Set-Up and not the completed device. 
Note: It is mandatory to Close the Arduino IDE & let the USB Cable stay connected to your PC as Python will be using the Serial Port to communicate with Arduino UNO
Note: During the first RUN, things might not all work. Some values in the Arduino code must be changed to get the device to work perfectly. Beside each line of code I have described what it stands for. Please feel free to change the values & play around to get the right output.
